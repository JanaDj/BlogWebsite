                    <h2>Welcome to the Mean Blog</h2>
                    <p>
                            Contrary to its name, this is a nice and friendly space meant to bring people together and share experiences and stories.
                            <br><br>
                            The blog itself is split into 2 areas:
                            <br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Road to (not) becoming a developer </li>
                                <br>
                                    <p>
                                            This section tells a story, my story about trying to become a developer. 
                                            And while it is mainly designed to humor people, it also contains experiences, tips and tricks I’ve come along the way and its idea is to gather community of people with the same end goal, so we can share experiences and help each other.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                <li> Short stories</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>
                                            This section is a little different and it might even stand out from the whole blog concept. 
                                            <br>
                                            As the name suggests, this section purely consists of short stories, my short stories. And while they might not be too good, I have decided it is time to share them. While their primary idea was not to make people laugh, if they do at least that, they have served its purpose.
                                            <br>
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                            </ul>
                            So, without further a due, I welcome you all to the mean blog, feel free to reach out, chat, ask questions and leave your feedback regarding anything, it is always welcome.
