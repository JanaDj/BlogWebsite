                    <p>
                        My name is Jana Djordjevic. I am 25 years old and as you can see from my blog posts, I am trying to become a developer. <br><br>
                        A couple of things worth mentioning about me: <br>
                        1. I love animals and I have a dog (Kira 3 y/o) and 2 cats (Blizzy 9 y/o and Zoe 6 m/o) <br>
                        2. I enjoy reading and music, and I have some strange need to buy instruments and try to learn them (making a collection of instruments I suppose) <br>
                        3. I used to study Veterinary Medicine before starting Software Engineering <br>
                        4. My career started at customer support and for the past 1.5 years I've been working as QA enigneer. <br>
                        <br>
                        I enjoy learning, studying, reading, however, I also love playing video games and I tend to procrastinate, so I am my own worst enemy. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Thats about it, the rest you'll have to find out by reading my bloog or joining me on stream (comming soon).
